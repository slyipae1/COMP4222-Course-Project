# Understanding Hallucinations in LLMs: A Graph-Based Reproduction Study (COMP4222 Course project)



## Overview


## group members & Task distibution:
    + YIP Sau Lai: conduct enperiments on similarity threshold and embedding model
        + replace BERT with DeBERTa: pipeline/grapg/make_graph_DeBERTa.py
        + for each embedding model, used thresholds: 0.60, 0.65, 0.70, 0.75, 0.80, 0.85, 0.90, 0.95
        + result: threshold&embed.tar.gz
